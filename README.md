# CALLBACK and CALLBACK HELL

### A function is called a callback function when it is passed as an argument for another function.
for example:   
* map(),reduce(),filter() functions,
* setTimeout() function etc...  

A callback hell is a situation when we have nested callback functions which makes it difficult to debug.

## In this TASK:

callback hell has been used to display coundown timer of 10 to 1 and then display "Happy Independence Day".
